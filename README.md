# sg-tech-events-finder

This is a simple Node.js app to scrape the Meetup website to find Tech groups in Singapore, and the upcoming events for them.

This is still a WIP.

- [x] Scrape results from Meetup SG Tech Groups
- [x] Parse events RSS to retrieve upcoming events
- [ ] Determine event details such as start time & venue


Event details are intended to display as notifications shown in [DevSG_Skills events telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/BGedIEXk14wejiRXgH7BGw). 

Some examples are shown below.

```
‚è∞ 7:00 pm - Improve Monitoring and Observability for Kubernetes with OSS tools (Azure, Office and Data Community (Singapore)) - üìçOnline event
‚è∞ 6:00 pm - Social Coding (Women Who Code Singapore) - üìçGeoHall @ GeoWorks, PSA Building, 460 Alexandra Road #07-01
```

This meant that the data required would be
```js
‚è∞ `${event_start_time} - ${event_name} ${group_name} üìç ${isOnline ? 'Online Event' : event_venue}`
```

## Demo

### Scrape Results

Scrape results can be found in `/demo`. The formatted result is in `groups.json`.

An example of an item found in the list of formatted results

```json
{
    "Tech Talks Thoughtworks Singapore": {
        "groupUrl": "https://www.meetup.com/Tech-Talks-Thoughtworks-Singapore",
        "eventsUrl": "https://www.meetup.com/Tech-Talks-Thoughtworks-Singapore/events/rss"
    },
}
```

They are pretty self-explanatory what they are.

You can use the eventsUrl here to check for upcoming events. If you can't find any in the XML file, that means that group has no upcoming events.

### Parsed RSS

The parsed events from the `eventsUrl` result is in `eventsFromRss.json` 

An example of an item found in the list of results 

```json
"Singapore Kafka Meetup": [
        {

        }
    ],
```

However, unlike usual RSS feeds for articles where we can just rely on the `pubDate` property to know the article's published date, for these events, we cannot determine the event's actual start & end times from these RSS items. They only tell us that these events are upcoming.

### Determine event details

Hence, to grab the event details, we would have to login as an **anonymous** user to meetup.com, and to get the event details from `JSON.parse($('#__NEXT_DATA__').innerHTML)`.

An example of the result can be found in `pageProps.json`. The important filtered parts are shown below.

```json
{
    "props": {
        "pageProps": {
            "event": {
                "title": "Getting started with Kubernetes",
                "eventUrl": "https://www.meetup.com/platform-engineers-nyc/events/284092401",
                "dateTime": "2022-03-24T14:00-04:00",
                "endTime": "2022-03-24T15:00-04:00",
                "isOnline": true,
                "howToFindUs": "https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/6316451792552/WN_2Bzx5STATuaM-iBZEZvE5w",
        }
    }
}
```
## Limitations

A minority of RSS urls the app gives you may say that you don't have auth to access. That is probably something that needs to configured by that group's admin.
